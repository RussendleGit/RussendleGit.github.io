  <h3 style= "color:#ccc">What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
  <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 25px;" >In the sense of Cybersecurity. You protect people, devices & networks. From crinimal exploitation, from threat hackers.</p>

<h3 style= "color:#ccc">What are The Benefits of Cybersecurity?</h3>
  <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 25px;" >
     There are many benefits, but the big ones are both Internal and External.
     For example, for some external benefits are: 
     you have confidential documents for your company, 
     and you take them home to review. 
     You will know what to do with those documents in order not to leak them. 
    </p>
  <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 25px;" >
    There are also some internal benefits, such as clicking links using HTTPS instead of HTTP. 
    The S in HTTP’S" means Secure, which comes with many benefits over HTTP. 
    This website is hosted under GitHub, which uses HTTPS, so you're free to give any PII to me! (dont)
    </p>
  <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 25px;" >
    But what are some other benefits? 
    Some of them include meeting Compliance so that you or your company follows the law. 
    So if a data breach happens, you don't owe the government anything*, 
    which also helps maintain the company!</p>

        Computer Virus
      </h4>
        <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 50px;" >

       In 1986 the Alve brothers created the “Brain Virus” to track illegal copies of 
       medical software, and to stop piracy as a whole. 
       With the consequence of any disk with pirated software on it,

    <h3 style= "color:#ccc">The Morris worm</h3>
      <p style= "color:#ccc;margin-left: 50px;" >
        In 1988 Robert Morris made the Morris virus. A program to estemate the size of the Internet, 
        it crawled across computers infecting them to add them to a count to the size of the Internet. 
        But an unitended bug apeared causing it to duplicate itself across the same computer, 
        adding to the number of computers to preposterous amounts, 
        also making those computers crash into an unuseable state with the low memory of the computers. 
        It effected around six thousand computers which was 10% of the internet at the time.
      </p>
    <h3 style= "color:#ccc">The I Love You Virus</h3>
